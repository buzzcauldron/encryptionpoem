You cannot get the curve out of your head -
The high arch of line, nobility
Of the lie: feather and threads
To thread through bloody feathers
Which lie secret, but now!
The snap of sudden sunlighted spray,
Gravity reminding you of itself
And the lake which recently floated
All things has become a clear cliff
For the feather-frond-fingered
To crawl up to the mud below you.
A slackening at last – release, a tug
But the tug is a sign that he cannot pull,
And tensely strung he lies in your hands,
Cold, monstrous, but with skin
That has distilled the sunrise
And the flecked mountains into itself,
And it gasps for water, showing secret
Bloodfeathers and he's hooked through the eye,
And he pulled you until your man's arms
Were tired - through his eye. He lives,
You think, and wonder as he flicks away -
Is it casting out an eye if you hold the lie?
The weight of the line grows
But you grow more deft;
Above you, below him, the sunset glows
But only he has a redfeather cleft.
