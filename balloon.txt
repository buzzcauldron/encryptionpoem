I crush water balloons so cold
I can feel the heels of my hands.
Bursts of color gone above
Your braids touching parallel.
Your rejoinder, running my spine
Cold, under my clinging shirt.
My eye to your eye, mutual melancholy:
Care not to touch skin,
Your presence like a skin with
No electric contact, cold water
Running down my spine, Demeter-eyed
Looking down my armor, braided hair
Warming in the sun.
