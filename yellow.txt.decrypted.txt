The yellow bells of summer blooms
Scent, silent swaying censors,
Every Dryad’s sweet, half-held breath.

Hiding amidst the verdant veins
Of oak and ash and maple leaves
The elfin eyes always gaze,

Wond’ring at the dazzling world,
Tracing the loveliness in all
But in you, especially.

Transfixed by but your flitting past,
Their sharp, bright, searching eyes know
That you are incomparable, a beauty

Divine in your exceeding fair
Red-gold tresses and briar-rose skin –
Ivory brushed by the light of dawn.

They know, too, that you were stolen,
Stolen from a noble glade of elm,
The lacing pillars of a forest-hall.

Above, the lapis-lazuli bent –
The skies a gem cut thin for your delight –
All o’erarching a wending thread,

A rippling stream, a golden course,
Sweet and cool beyond compare,
Heady like wine in that light-pied place.

From the branch-woven bower,
Strewn with sleepy violet-flowers
By the gold-wine winding flume,

Some strange unspoken fate
Snatched you from your glowing home,
Thou, fairest and immortal pearl.

Grieving came upon that lovely place,
Shrouded now in a stormy veil,
A tempest of bitter discontent.

How you came to me, my love,
Is a tale I can never know,
For the trees do grieve to tell it.

But I have held your undying hand
While you spoke soft and close
And have seen your sylphan smile.

Some now doubt that you a goddess are
And say you are but mortal fair,
But when I see your emerald eyes alight,

I know the deep, fleet fire
Of the sun-touched summer stream
Of your sweet soul.
